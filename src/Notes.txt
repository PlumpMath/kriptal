Kriptal
Serverless End-to-End Encrypted Blockchain Messenger
Simulated virtual keyboard to stay away from keyloggers
5000 rounds of BLAKE2 and SHA3

Serverless in most of cases is a lie. There are servers in most "serverless" solutions. 
The point is, dear friend, "Serverless" in mosts of cases, means you dont own the server and the data, 
you don't own nothing XD". But Kriptal, don't use ANY server. 
Kriptal have his own DNS stored in the blockchain itselfs. Kriptal have the Public Keys for Asymetric Encription in the blockchain. Kriptal don't need servers. Kriptal only connects with your secure node network.

Kriptal don't lies. Kriptal is real serverless, peer to peer TCP connections. 
Kriptal don't lies, because he can't. Kriptal uses blockchain to store everything you need, 
and that peer to peer distributed blockchain is the mathematical truth that can't be supressed. 
The past is the truth and the blockchain itself rejects false, hacked, or fake data.
